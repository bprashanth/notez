## TODOs

Cross org collab

we have a pipeline 
Use this pipeline to bring interop/sharing within and across orgs 

- pitch an expansion of pw that matches our pipeline (within org) 
- use lantana as an explainer to data discrepancies (cross org)

Absence points could be a great standardizing variable and indicator 

Lantana layer combined from different input sources
