Hi Shankar,

Hope you're doing well! Let us know when you might be available for a 1 hour call. 
We’d love to discuss a few key points with you:

1. Walk through some of the finer details in the MOU
2. Revisit a couple of directions we brainstormed during and after the field trip
3. Discuss how we can regularize updates and plan for future field testing of the app

We’re especially excited about the possibility of getting a few more datasets that we can begin feeding into point (2), eventually leading into (3).

Looking forward to catching up, just let us know a convenient time.
Thanks,
Prashanth
