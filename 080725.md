## TODOs

* Dante email
* Rohit draft 

* Work on app features and pipeline for field work 
* Uttam connect on drons - regulations, supply chain, disaster management (prediction), dissemmination, facilitate ops 

* Rewrite post-coalition sections for CWS / lipok
	- add a column for "stage" 
	- community idea comes out in both, one is github and one is village
* Read year 2 and transition it into RNP narrative
* EDGE email  
* AIs for second field testing 
* Scope out how Eco model (Rohit's stuff) fits into platform 
* Do own Signature
* Write  Dante email
* Scope out gbif and reporting infra (look at myna) 
* Finish query interface 
* Scope out "publishing" via s3

July/August: coalition building work 
Dashboard, app, query interface 
Tech product ideas to go down the list of





Hi Dante, 

Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to touch base and share a quick update since we last spoke. 

You might recall the proof of concept we showed you, which included several AI integrations - like MegaDetector for animal identification and PlatnNet for plant species. Since then, we've spent some time in the field and focused our efforts on a use case that's proving immediately valuable: identifying lantana patches from drone orthomosaics. 

If you're curious, you can take a quick look at the pipeline [here](). It's an early iteration and currently runs on Detectron2. 

I'd love to explore how we might collaborate with you our your team on a few fronts: 

1. Model Improvement: Any suggestions, tweaks or contributions - open to all forms of engagement here. 
2. Field Deployment: We're building dashboards and tools to bring these insights to field teams. We'd love to demo what we've got and get your feedback. 
3. Emerging Use Cases: As we engage more with the field, new needs are surfacing, like tracking the movement of large animals. Would love to hear your thoughts on how to approach these. 

Do let me know if you're open to a call. Happy to contiue this discussion asynchronously, over email too. 

Looking to connect, exchange ideas and explore potential overlays. 
Thanks,
Prashanth 




Hi Dante, 

How are you? Just thought I'd touch base and give you a quick update. 
If you recall the last time we spoke I showed you a proof of concept of sorts that had several AI offshoots - megadetector for animal id, plat net for plat species etc. 
Since then we have visited the field and centered around one clear use case that is immediately useful to conservationists. The identification of lantana patches from drone orthomosaics. 

If you'd like a quick look at the pipeline it's here. 

It's just a first cut of the model, and it uses detectron2. 

I'd love to explore how we might enagege either you or your team along 2 dimensions: 
1. Improving the model itself: tips, tweaks, suggestsion, patches, open to all forms of engagement here 
2. We're also building systems to take these insights to the field. Both dashboards and tooling. We'd love to walk you through these and get your take on it. 
3. We're starting to discover new use cases from the field (eg movement tracking of large animals) an want to know if you have ideas on how to proceed.
