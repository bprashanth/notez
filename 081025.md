We are building data systems to close the loop on both removal and restoration of the sholas, and do so in ways that support communities. We heard they're helping shola with lantan identification. 

Given similar goals (their work seems to focus on PES for farmers) we can look for ways to collaborate..

# Tarkam

* Bharat - looking at data 



This current script was meant to overlay the output of textract output returned with 
aws textract analyze-document   --region ap-south-1   --document '{"S3Object": {"Bucket":"fomomonguest","Name":"keystone/002.png"}}'   --feature-types '["TABLES"]'   --output json > output/002_cropped.json

The output is in @002_cropped.json 

On the img_path and write the output to OUT_PATH

Now i have modified the command to include 

aws textract analyze-document   --region ap-south-1   --document '{"S3Object": {"Bucket":"fomomonguest","Name":"keystone/002.png"}}'   --feature-types '["TABLES", "FORMS", "LAYOUT"]'   --output json > output/002_layout.json

The output is in @002_layout.json 

Explain the main changes to the json produced, and modify the scirpt to incorporate these (eg if the column headings are indicated, then write to the final file the column headings with a different color so its clear)
