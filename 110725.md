## TODOs


* Send email on AIs for second field testing 
* Uttam connect on drons - regulations, supply chain, disaster management (prediction), dissemmination, facilitate ops 
* EDGE email  
* Scope out gbif and reporting infra (look at myna) 


Hi Bharat, 

So we had a quick huddle after our call and decided to bring you in on our way of thinking.

1. We think 2 workshops would be better than 1. The first one, with just us (only T4GC) can happen ASAP - say next week? if you're ok with this, do let me know if you need anything else. As described the types we _currently_ deal with are geo data (shp, kml, geojson), tiffs, excel, json/csv, images, orthomosaics (geotiffs transformed into pngs). By and large I transform everything into json where possible, store the blobs in s3, and query it using natural language that translates to sql/alasql depending on the use case. 

2. The second workshop we would like to have with multiple partner orgs (eg representatives from NCF, Shola etc). 

3. We want to explain to our partners the value of doing this even within their own orgs. So setting aside the ecosystem sharing angle, say something like if you do this within your own org, we can build interfaces and pipelines that map your data set across orgs automatically (ml pipelines etc like we discussed). 

4. Ideally, do a quick session+demo of *something* that demonstrates the higher order value of this kind of operation, as well as explain the higher level conservation goal to them in eg a 20m session that follows yours. 

In order to prepare for this we will need a good month's worth of time. 
But since I am in Bangalore, we can just have the T4GC session whenever you're free. 
Does that make sense? 

Hi Bharat,

We had a brief internal huddle after our call, just wanted to loop you into our current thinking.

1. We’d like to split this into two workshops rather than one. The first workshop will be just with us (T4GC) and can happen as soon as next week, if that works for you. Let us know if you need anything in advance (I've added type details to the end of this email).

2. The second workshop will include partner organizations — for example, representatives from NCF, Shola Trust, and others. We will have to start figuring out these details post our first workshop. 

3. In that second session, we want to demonstrate the value of this approach even within an individual organization — independent of cross-org data sharing. The idea is that once internal data pipelines are in place, we can build systems that automatically map and interoperate across organizations (as we discussed, eg through ML pipelines, shared schema, etc.).

4. We’re hoping to follow your session with a short (~20 min) segment where we show a quick demo of something that illustrates the higher-order value of this kind of work, as well as tie it to broader conservation goals.

We’ll need a few weeks to prep for the partner session, but since I’m in Bangalore, we can do the T4GC-only session anytime you're available.

Let me know if this plan sounds good, and feel free to ask for any additional info.
